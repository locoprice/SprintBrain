# SprintBrain — Root Engineering Standards

**Scope**: Global rules for all packages in this monorepo.  
**Priority**: These rules override nothing in nested `CLAUDE.md` files — they set the floor. Module-level files may add stricter rules for their own scope.  
**Phase**: Pre-seed (Phase 2) — production-quality bar is non-negotiable.

---

## 🎯 Core Feature — Non-Negotiable
**UX/UI excellence and extreme ease of navigation is the primary goal of this project.**  
Every task, feature, and fix must be evaluated first against its impact on simplicity and ease of use.

### Guiding Principles (apply in every session)
- **UX/UI First:** Technical decisions are only acceptable if they preserve or improve the user experience. A technically elegant solution that degrades UX is unacceptable.
- **Navigation Clarity:** Intuitive, low-friction navigation flows take priority over all other concerns. If a feature complicates the interface, it must be redesigned before shipping.
- **Simplicity over Features:** Fewer, well-executed interactions beat many complex ones. Resist feature creep that adds cognitive load.
- **Visible Feedback:** Every user action must produce a clear, immediate, and meaningful response (loading states, success/error signals, confirmation).
- **Consistency:** Visual language, interaction patterns, and terminology must be uniform across the extension and web app.

---

## 🧠 Philosophy
- **Production-first:** Stability and predictability over speed.
- **Zero-defect mindset:** No regressions, no silent failures, no degraded UX.
- **Explicit over implicit:** Clear contracts, typed boundaries, deterministic behavior.
- **AI-assisted development:** Must increase quality, not bypass engineering discipline.
- **Codebase hygiene:** Every change must leave the codebase cleaner, safer, and easier to maintain.

---

## 🚫 Forbidden
- Temporary fixes, quick hacks, or patch-style solutions.
- TODO/FIXME placeholders in production code.
- Commented-out dead code.
- Duplicate logic or copy-paste implementations.
- Silent failures or swallowed exceptions.
- Debug logs committed to production (`console.log`, `console.warn` for debugging).
- TypeScript `any` usage (applies to `app/` — extension is vanilla JS, see `docs/CLAUDE.md`).
- Hidden side effects or implicit mutations.
- Disabling lint/type rules to force builds passing.
- Skipping validation, tests, or verification steps.

---

## ✅ Mandatory
- Preserve backward compatibility unless explicitly approved.
- Validate impacted flows after every modification.
- Keep changes atomic and minimize file surface area.
- Prefer composition over duplication.
- Prefer readability over clever abstractions.
- Add/update tests when business logic changes (see Testing Standards below).
- Log meaningful operational errors with actionable context.
- Maintain strict typing and predictable data flow (where TypeScript applies).
- Keep bundle size and runtime performance under control.

---

## 🔍 Verification Protocol

### After Every Change
1. Run incremental validation immediately.
2. Fix all lint/type errors before continuing.
3. Verify no console warnings/errors remain.
4. Validate impacted UI flows manually.
5. Confirm no regressions introduced.
6. Ensure no unrelated functionality was altered.

### Before Every Commit — `app/` (React/TypeScript)
The following gates are mandatory. All must pass before committing:

```bash
cd app
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm run build
# npm run test  ← will be added once the test framework is in place (TESTING-001)
```

### Before Every Commit — Extension (vanilla JS)
No build step. Gates are:
- Manual smoke test: trigger expansion, overlay, formula calculation, context menu
- Confirm no `console.log` debug statements committed
- Reload extension at `chrome://extensions` and verify no errors in service worker

#### Required Summary Format
Every implementation summary must include:

**Changes made:**
- ...

**Verification:**
- lint: PASS / FAIL / N/A
- typecheck: PASS / FAIL / N/A
- build: PASS / FAIL / N/A
- manual test: PASS / FAIL

**Regression check:**
- Result: PASS / FAIL
- Impacted scope: [modules / routes / components / APIs]

---

## 🐛 Bug Fix Protocol

These rules apply to every bug fix task, without exception.

### Step 1 — Reproduce first, code second
Before touching a single line of code, Claude **must** reproduce the bug. This means running the exact steps that trigger the failure and observing it directly. Guessing at a fix without confirmed reproduction is forbidden.

> **If the bug cannot be reproduced:** Stop immediately. Do not make any code change. Ask the user for a clearer reproduction case (exact steps, environment, inputs, expected vs actual behavior) before continuing.

### Step 2 — Fix only what is broken
The fix must be scoped strictly to the reported bug. No refactoring, cleanup, or opportunistic improvements beyond the failing behavior — unless explicitly approved. Scope creep during a bug fix introduces untested risk.

### Step 3 — Verify the fix is complete
A bug fix is **not done** until all four gates pass:

1. **Re-reproduce** — Run the exact same steps that triggered the bug and confirm it no longer occurs.
2. **Related flows** — Manually test every user flow that touches the changed code, not just the broken path.
3. **Regression test** — Add a test (unit or integration) that would have caught this bug, so it cannot silently return.
4. **Automated gates** — `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build` must all pass (for `app/`).

### Hard rules
- **Never ship a fix that introduces a new bug.** Zero-regression policy: if fixing A breaks B, the task remains open.
- **Never mark a task complete without end-to-end verification.** The fix must be confirmed working in the actual runtime, not just in theory.

### Communication during bug fixes
Work silently and autonomously. Surface a message only when genuinely blocked — not for status updates, intermediate findings, or routine progress. The final report uses the standard summary format above.

---

## 🧪 Regression Policy
- Mandatory regression analysis before implementation.
- Map affected modules, APIs, routes, state flows, and dependencies.
- Re-test critical user paths after changes.
- High-risk changes require smoke tests across related modules.
- No merge allowed with unresolved regressions.
- New features must not degrade existing performance or UX.

---

## 📝 Commit Rules
- **Format:** `type(scope): concise description`
- One logical change per commit.
- No WIP commits on shared branches.
- No debug code or temporary instrumentation.
- Squash noisy history before merge when appropriate.
- Reference issue/ticket IDs when available.

### Accepted Types
`feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `docs`, `build`, `chore`

---

## 🧪 Testing Standards

> **Current state (Phase 2):** The Chrome extension uses manual testing only (no test framework). The `app/` dashboard has no automated test suite yet — this is tracked as `TESTING-001`. Rules below define the standard to build toward.

### Unit Testing
- Required for utilities and business logic.
- Cover edge cases and failure states.
- Avoid implementation-detail testing.

### Integration Testing
- Required for APIs, routes, auth flows, and critical UI paths.
- Validate real interaction between modules.

### E2E / Smoke Testing
- Required for critical production flows: Authentication, Dashboard actions, Extension communication, Data persistence flows.

### CI Rules (once TESTING-001 lands)
- Never hit live production services during CI.
- Mock external providers and unstable dependencies.
- Flaky tests are treated as failures.
- **Coverage target:** ≥80% lines, ≥80% branches.

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Standards
- Strict module boundaries; zero circular dependencies.
- TypeScript strict mode enforced globally in `app/`.
- Explicit return types for exported functions (`app/`).
- **Separation of concerns:** UI, Logic, Data, Config, Infrastructure.
- External services must use dedicated service layers.
- Shared logic belongs in reusable modules, not duplicated components.
- State must remain predictable and traceable.
- Favor pure functions and immutable patterns.

---

## ⚡ Performance Standards
- Avoid unnecessary renders and re-fetching.
- Lazy-load heavy modules when possible.
- Prevent memory leaks and dangling listeners.
- Optimize critical rendering paths.
- Keep Lighthouse and Core Web Vitals within acceptable production range.
- Monitor bundle growth continuously.

---

## 🔐 Security Standards
- Zero secrets committed to the repository (env vars + secret manager only).
- Validate and sanitize all inputs; escape outputs by default.
- Principle of least privilege everywhere.
- Enforce authentication and authorization checks globally.
- Apply: CORS, CSRF protection, rate limiting, secure headers.
- Patch critical vulnerabilities within 48h.
- Never trust client-side validation alone.

---

## 🤖 AI Collaboration Rules
- AI must not invent APIs, schemas, or dependencies.
- AI must verify existing architecture before modifying code.
- AI should prefer minimal safe edits over broad rewrites.
- AI must explain risky operations before applying them.
- AI should proactively identify: regressions, performance risks, architectural inconsistencies, and security concerns.
- AI-generated code is never assumed correct without validation.

### CLAUDE.md hierarchy

| File | Scope |
|------|-------|
| `/CLAUDE.md` | **This file** — global floor for all packages |
| `/docs/CLAUDE.md` | Chrome Extension — vanilla JS, MV3, no-build rules |
| `/app/CLAUDE.md` | React/TypeScript dashboard — strict TS, Vite, Supabase |

Local module rules extend but never weaken the global standards defined here.

---

## 🔄 CI / Build Pipeline

### GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
Runs on every push to `develop`. Three gates must pass:

1. **Version parity** — `scripts/check-version.js` verifies `extension/manifest.json` version matches `app/package.json`. Both must be kept in sync; increment together.
2. **Formula validation** — `scripts/check-snippets.js` validates snippet template/formula syntax.
3. **File structure** — Asserts `extension/manifest.json`, `app/index.html`, and `app/package.json` exist.

### Dashboard build (Netlify)
Auto-deploys from `main` via `netlify.toml` (`base = "app"`, publishes `dist/`).

```bash
cd app
npm ci && npm run build   # tsc -b && vite build → app/dist/
```

### Extension (no build)
Chrome MV3 extension loads directly from `extension/` — no compilation, no bundling.
Manual reload always required: `chrome://extensions` → Reload.

---

## 🚀 Release Standard
A feature or fix is considered complete only if:
- Build passes
- Lint and typecheck pass
- Regression checks pass
- No console noise exists
- UX is validated on the target surface (desktop for dashboard; Chrome for extension)
- Types are strict (where TypeScript applies)
- No temporary workaround remains
- Documentation is updated if architecture changed
